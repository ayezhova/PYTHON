# PYTHON
I've started learning Python, and here are some of my projects along the way!


| Date          | Project            | Description | Possible Future Extensions |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| 6/25/20       | Guess the Number!  | The user has a certain number of guesses to figure out the randomly selected number. Includes randomness, user input and try-catch blocks  | To increase replayability of the game, MIN and MAX values could be shifted each round, such as by adding a random number from [-5, 5] to each value each time the player chooses to replay the game. The number of guesses the play has could also be shifted by [-2, 2]. Additionally, game could offer hints to player as number of guesses dwindle, such as 'The number is higher than your current guess!'  |
| 7/9/20        | Maximum Width of Binary Tree | My solution to [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-width-of-binary-tree/) leetcode problem, based on the theory presented in [Knowledge Center's very helpful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le-ZZSQRebw)! Runtime beats 98.45 % of other python3 submissions to leetcode. | Currently I've only included the solution function, which need leetcode's interface to run. In the future I'd love to implement my own main. |
| 9/11/20        | Route Between Nodes | I've started looking into the graph data structures.  I'm a bit surprised how quick it is to put the graph class together! I also used a queue class to help with my breadth first search when searching whether a path exists | Currently on returning whether path exists or not. Could return shortest number of steps to get to the node, which is why bfs is handy, and output the path to get to it. |
