# PYTHON
I've started learning Python, and here are some of my projects along the way!


| Date          | Project            | Description | Possible Future Extensions |

| 6/25/20       | Guess the Number!  | The user has a certain number of guesses to figure out the randomly selected number. Includes randomness, user input and try-catch blocks  | To increase replayability of the game, MIN and MAX values could be shifted each round, such as by adding a random number from [-5, 5] to each value each time the player chooses to replay the game. The number of guesses the play has could also be shifted by [-2, 2]. Additionally, game could offer hints to player as number of guesses dwindle, such as 'The number is higher than your current guess!'  |
